# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

A personal Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind app for tracking a watch wishlist. The collection is a single version-controlled JSON file — `data/watches.json` — read and written through `src/lib/store.ts`. There is no database.

## Commands

```bash
npm run check              # validate:data + audit:data + audit:calibers + lint + build — run before proposing a change is done
npm test                   # vitest
npm run dev                # local dev server
npm run validate:data      # schema and plausibility check for watches.json; fast, but not the whole gate
npm run audit:data         # data acceptance criteria (every watch has a category, caliber match rate, …)
npm run audit:calibers     # every recorded mechanical caliber must resolve to a tier
npm run build:static       # GitHub Pages export, into out/
npm run calibrate:scoring  # read-only comparison of current vs proposed scoring
npm run notify:targets     # target-met webhook notifications; use --dry first
```

`validate:data` passing does not mean `check` passes: the two audits gate things validation doesn't, such as a watch added with no scoring category. Run the full `check` before proposing any change to `watches.json`.

## Architecture notes

**`data/watches.json` is the source of truth.** The in-app forms rewrite the whole file, which reorders keys — so a one-field edit can show up as a 500-line diff. When reviewing a change to this file, diff it *semantically* (parse both sides and compare field by field) rather than reading the raw patch, or you will badly misjudge the scope.

**The scoring engine is the opinionated part** — `src/lib/scoring.ts` (standing engine, design score, quadrants) and `src/lib/rubrics.ts` (dimensions, price bands, per-category rubric tables). Three invariants hold it together. They were each arrived at by fixing a bug where the opposite behavior misled, so preserve them:

1. **Missing data is never a zero.** A dimension without source data returns `undefined` and is excluded from the composite. `unratedReason()` explains which input is missing. Never substitute a neutral or mid value to "fill in" a gap — a fabricated score reads as a measured failure.
2. **Friction is never numeric.** `friction` (availability, bracelet upcharge, brand liquidity) renders as text chips via `frictionChips()`. It must not enter any score.
3. **Par is absolute.** A watch at its band's rubric reference scores 0.5. Peer groups range from a single watch to about ten, so they supply only the label and count; percentile ranking is gated behind `n >= 6`.

`unratedReason()` mirrors the gates in `scoreDimensions()`. Change one and the other must follow.

**Quality flags are tri-state: omitted is not false.** Each `qualityFlags` input counts only when recorded (`!== undefined`). `true` earns credit, an explicit `false` is recorded evidence of absence, and an omitted flag leaves its input unknown — it lowers evidence coverage, never the score. A stated AR layer count (`arLayers`) outranks a plain `arCoated`, so never reduce a count to the boolean. `withCrystalArInference()` in `src/lib/quality-flags.ts` fills an unset `arCoated` from crystal text that states AR, and runs on save (`addWatch` / `changeWatch`), not at score time; an explicit value always wins.

**`priceHistory` records moves, not polls.** `appendSnapshot()` in `src/lib/price-history.ts` is a no-op when the price is unchanged, so consecutive entries always differ and each `date` means "unchanged since". Consumers rely on the series being oldest-first with the newest entry equal to `price`; both validators enforce that. Don't add a snapshot per scrape run — it would add a line per watch per run to `watches.json` and destroy the meaning of the dates. `updateWatch()` appends automatically on a price change, so callers should not build the series by hand unless they are importing one (passing `priceHistory` explicitly suppresses the automatic append).

**A link's `askHistory` follows the same moves-only rule, per listing URL.** `recordAskMove()` in `src/lib/listing-history.mjs` (shared with `enrich-watches.mjs`) appends only when that link's ask changes; `observedAt` still advances on every confirmation, so the two dates mean different things. A changed ask that arrives with the old `observedAt` (the form sends an untouched date back as `YYYY-MM-DD`) is re-dated to now, since that date belongs to the previous ask. The form never sends `askHistory`, so `updateWatch()` carries trails across edits by URL. A currency change restarts the trail rather than comparing through a rate snapshot.

**Alerts fire on change, never on read.** `detectAlerts(before, after)` in `src/lib/alerts.mjs` compares a watch before and after a write; `updateWatch()` and `enrich-watches.mjs --refresh` are the two callers, and both go through `appendAlerts()` for the 24h dedupe, mutes and type switches. Don't compute alerts from current data at page load: every refresh re-dates every link, so a read-time feed can't tell a new offer from a re-checked one. The log is `data/alerts.json` (committed, read-only on Pages). Adding a watch or editing its target never fires an alert. `watchAlertStatus()` in `src/lib/alert-status.ts` explains per watch which types can fire; it mirrors the gates in `detectAlerts()`, so change them together.

**Calibers have two tables.** `src/lib/caliber-aliases.mjs` owns *naming* — how free-text caliber strings normalize to a canonical key, shared with the audit scripts. `CALIBER_TIER_PATTERNS` in `scoring.ts` owns *worth* — a hand-maintained substring table, ordered most-specific-first. Unknown calibers return `undefined` (unrated), never a fallback tier. Adding watches from new movement families means adding entries to both; `audit:calibers` fails on a recorded caliber that doesn't resolve.

**`src/lib/spec-ranges.mjs` is `.mjs` on purpose** — it's imported by both the TypeScript app and `scripts/validate-data.mjs`, which runs under bare Node with no build step. Don't convert it to `.ts`.

**The scraper must stop where the product ends.** `productExtractionText()` / `primaryProductText()` in `src/lib/scrape.ts` choose the page text that autofill reads. A spec section starts at a technical heading or anchor (EN, DE, FR, ES, IT) and ends at a `PRODUCT_END` marker (reviews, testimonials, cross-sells, FAQs). Text past that point has produced real false values — flags from customer reviews, another model's sapphire bezel, a GMT from a review of a different watch. When a page leaks, add a narrow end marker and a trimmed fixture in `src/lib/fixtures/` rather than loosening a spec pattern. Extraction never invents: prefer a blank field plus the coverage note (`specCoverage()`) to a guessed value. Before committing scraped data, compare the saved values against the source page.

**Static export.** `IS_STATIC` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_STATIC=true`) drops dynamic rendering and hides write actions. `npm run build:static` (`scripts/build-static.mjs`) copies the repo to a temp directory, where `scripts/prepare-pages.mjs` deletes `src/app/api`, `watch/new`, and `watch/[id]/edit` before building — Pages can't run a server. Any new server-dependent route needs handling in both places.

**Spec fields are declared once** in `src/lib/specs.ts` and drive the form, detail view, and comparison table together. Add a field there, not in three components.

## Data-maintenance scripts

`scripts/enrich-watches.mjs` (scrapes prices/images) and `scripts/backfill-specs.mjs` (fills specs via the Claude API with web search; needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) require **real outbound network access**. The cloud sandbox blocks retailer domains through its egress proxy — every fetch returns 403. Run them locally, and use `--dry` first.

Both are conservative: they fill gaps and never overwrite. Keep it that way. They write `watches.json` directly, so store-level save rules such as `withCrystalArInference()` don't apply to them.

`scripts/notify-targets.mjs` sends target-met notifications to `WATCH_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` (`WATCH_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_FORMAT`: generic, slack or discord) and records what it sent in `data/notify-state.json`. `--refresh` runs the enrich script first; `--dry` sends nothing. `scripts/calibrate-scoring.ts` compares current and proposed scoring and never writes data.

## Conventions

- Comments explain *why*, especially in the scoring code, where several constants encode a decision that a plausible-looking alternative got wrong. Match that density — don't strip the rationale comments.
- Work on a branch off `main` (the default branch), not directly on it.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` triggers on `main` alone — it is the single branch that publishes. Renaming the default branch means updating that trigger.
- Implementation briefs live in `docs/briefs/`, with shared constraints in `00-working-agreements.md`. When a brief asserts how the engine behaves, measure it before building on the claim.
